# Hira-Bio-Readme
Hello my name is Hira and I am a rising junior. I am interested in the computer science field, although I am currently figuring out what career I want to pursue. I have done a bit of coding in the past, however I did not learn much because it was not an everyday class. By learning to use GitHub, I aim to collaborate with others on various projects, build my portfolio, and learn how to code better from others.
